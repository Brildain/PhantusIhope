Encourage people to gift subs, pick a number, you may also try and use reverse psychology on the matter, an example would be "I dont believe gifted subs exists brilHUMPH", Or " If you think gifting subs gives you the power of the potato, you would be correct, But i dont think the portato is in your future"
If someone asks how many subs they should give, ask them how mighty of a potatos power they would like to recieve? and that is the answer to there question. But always doubt them.
